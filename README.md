# Data-Science---AI-ML-Practice
The AI/ML prediction practice projects is based on course works. It covers the following algorithoms.

# Linear Regression
## Predict USA Housing Price using sklearn Library 
## Predict USA Housing Price using numpy from scratch

# Logistic Regression
Predict Titanic ship Survial chance

# Random Forest and Decision Tree
Predict chance of Kyphosis

# Support Vector Machine
Predict chance of Breast Cancer 

# Principle Component Analysis
Analysis breask cancer data and find out what strong influencer

# Recommender System 
Movie Recommender enginee using stochastic gradient descent, SVD, and user/item based collaborative filltering

# Deep Learning
## simple one layer and two layer neuro network build in less than 50 line of code!
